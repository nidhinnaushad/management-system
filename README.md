# Employee-Management-System
Program in C language for Data Management: add, list,  modify and delete records.
# Abstract:
In this project, you can manage employee records â€“ add, list, 
modify and delete records. The main use of an employee 
management system is Better performance as a team and an easier 
way to manage admin tasks are just a couple of positive outcomes 
from using employee management systems. This program makes 
the job of a team admin way easier by making a detailed list of the 
days they come in for work, their salary division, etc. This code 
allows a table like format, but only with proper entry. Hence this 
code can be improved to user's needs, also different other sub 
programs or functions can be integrated into this code.
# Introduction:
This project is aimed at making a company more efficient by 
reducing the work load of manager admin. Tasks like keeping track 
of their attendance, their salary, number of hours worked and order 
of arrangement. This code although intended for employee 
management system can be used in any area that requires proper 
tabulation, sorting and arrangement of different data.
# Program:
It is a very simple code, menu driven code for data storage and 
management. Basically, the code builds an employee table, further 
operations like insertion, deletion, sorting and searching is done 
inside this table. The data for the table is taken from the admin. The 
program displays this table and allows for modification.
# Conclusion:
Into this code we could add a flag variable, that is to check the 
validity of an employee using RFID or any other technology and the 
output can be given to this code, then it can also be used for 
security. More for example, Image processing is becoming a huge 
trend, employees can be ensured to put on a helmet using this tech 
and that can also be tabulated by integrating into this code.
